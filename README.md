## Capstone Project:
Consolidation 

## About:
In this capstone project, I consolidated all that I have learnt up to now.
This prodject is a Django project with the added features of adding it to GitHub. The usage of Sphinx was added 
as well as a requirements.txt file.

## Requirements:
A requirements file has been added so no action needed.
asgiref==3.7.2
Django==4.2.6
sqlparse==0.4.4
tzdata==2023.3

## How to:
Run poll.html. If you do not have user detials to log in then simply click Register and create a profile. Once you have created
a profile you'll be able to select a question and will be able to vote. Once done voting you can close the browser.
